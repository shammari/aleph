Welcome! This webpage provides an overview of my research, academic & professional activities, and ongoing collaborations. It serves as a hub for sharing my work and activities in mathematical biology. Here, you can find details about my research themes, publications, and teaching, as well as ways to connect and collaborate.

Research Focus
======
I specialize in mathematical modeling and dynamical systems, with applications in physiology, epidemiology, and evolutionary biology. My research explores how structural heterogeneity—e.g., spatial, temporal, demographic, etc—may influence biological or physiological function.  

This work includes differential equations, asymptotic analysis, complex variables and computational modeling. Current applications are in:  
- Oxygen transport in muscle tissue  
- Epidemiological dynamics  
- Genotype-phenotype relationships  
- Mathematical interpretability of clinical datasets
