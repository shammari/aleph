## **Research Focus**
I specialize in **mathematical modeling and dynamical systems**, with applications in **physiology, epidemiology, and evolutionary biology**. My research explores how **heterogeneity—spatial, temporal, or demographic—affects underlying biological and physiological processes**.  

I use **differential equations, asymptotic analysis, and computational modeling** to study:  
- **Oxygen transport in muscle tissue**  
- **Epidemiological dynamics of multistrain diseases**  
- **Genotype-phenotype relationships**  
- **Mathematical interpretation of clinical datasets**  

## **Academic Appointments & Collaborations**
- Assistant Professor, **Kuwait University**  
- Visiting Research Fellow, **University of Leeds**  
- Former Visiting Scholar, **University of Oxford**  
- Research Associate, **Dasman Diabetes Institute**  
- Collaborator with **biomedical scientists and public health researchers**  

## **Interdisciplinary Work & Methods**
My work incorporates **finite element methods**, **conformal mapping (Henrici’s method)**, and **nonlinear dynamical systems** to investigate how **biological structures influence function**. This interdisciplinary approach connects **theoretical mathematics with real-world biomedical challenges**.
